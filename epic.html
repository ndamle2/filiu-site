    <h1>Epic</h1>
    <p>Epic, formally known as Epic Systems, is the leading Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) software company in the
      United States, based in Madison, Wisconsin.
      As a Summer 2023 User Experience Designer Intern here, I had the opportunity to own a project within their
      Telehealth application, alongside a paired Software Developer Intern.

    <h1>Premise</h1>

        <h5 class="premise-head">What is Telehealth?</h5>
        <p>Epic’s Telehealth application is dedicated to building software that enables patients to have access to
          healthcare from wherever they are.
          Their primary service is through the Epic Video Client (EVC), which is Epic’s homegrown browser-based
          videotelephony platform.</p>
        <h5 class="premise-head">What was the project?</h5>
        <p>As part of preparation for a Telehealth video visit, patients are encouraged to test their device to make
          sure that it’s working and ready to go. How they do this, is through a hardware test, and EVC currently has
          two:</p>

        <img class="premise-image" src="img/epic/epic3.png" alt="">
        <p>We worked on redesigning the Standalone Hardware Test, following customers concerns over its current
          interface.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <img class="diamonds" src="img/epic/diamond1.png" alt="">
  <div class="discover case-study">
    <h1>Preliminary Research</h1>
    <p>The time frame of the internship didn’t allow us to conduct formal user interviews, as contact and research with
      patients is done through a regulated process, but we looked to testing later on to validate our assumptions.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h5 id="discover-header">Baseline Heuristic Evaluation</h5>
    <p>I documented an assessment of the current interface within the internal heuristic evaluation system, and found
      violations in the following of Nielson Norman Group’s 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design:</p>
    <img id="violations" src="img/epic/epic35.svg" alt="">
    <img class="epic-full" src="img/epic/epic6.svg" alt="">
    <h5 id="discover-header">Competitive Analysis</h5>
    <p>I then took a look at the existing structures and successes of other hardware tests and noticed variations in:
    </p>
    <img class="epic-full" src="img/epic/epic7.svg" alt="">
    <p>Within the Feedback <span class="highlight">METHOD</span>, I found an interesting difference in Automated vs.
      Self-Directed testing that would impact the structure of our test later.</p>

  <img class="diamonds" src="img/epic/diamonds2.png" alt="">
  <div class="define case-study">
    <h5 id="define-header">Design Sprint</h5>
    <p>With all of these swirling understandings of the project, I decided that a Design Sprint might be the best way to
      resolve and flesh out any lingering questions and considerations in our problem space, as well as spark ideas for
      design and catch potential issues of our current trajectory.</p>
    <img class="epic-full" src="img/epic/epic9.svg" alt="">
    <p>I invited five other User Experience Designers, two Quality Managers, and three Software Developers for an
      intense 3 hour rapid brainstorm and sketch session, and we came up with a lot of valuable discussion and raw
      material...</p>
    <img class="epic-full" src="img/epic/epic10.png" alt="">
    <img class="epic-full" src="img/epic/epic11.svg" alt="">
    <p>...which I was then able to convert into some really useful affinity maps!</p>

    <img class="epic-full" src="img/epic/epic14.png" alt="">
    <h5 id="define-header">Problem Statement</h5>
    <p>Our problem statement then accumulated into...</p>
    <img class="problem-statement" src="img/epic/epic36.svg" alt="">
    <p>...with main goals being:</p>
    <img class="epic-full" src="img/epic/epic15.png" alt="">

  <img class="diamonds" src="img/epic/diamond3.png" alt="">
  <div class="design case-study">
    <h1>Iteration</h1>
    <p>I made and played around with <span class="big">2,000+ mockups</span> so not all could fit here! The following
      section will showcase samples from each stage of iteration, as well as some of our milestone decisions.</p>
    <h5 id="design-header">Sketches</h5>
    <p>Drawing from our Design Sprint collection, I sketched up some ideas.</p>
    <img class="epic-full" src="img/epic/epic16.svg" alt="">
    <h5 id="design-header">Lo-Fi</h5>
    <p>I then played around with some of our concepts through some lo-fi mockups of mobile and desktop.</p>
    <img class="epic-full" src="img/epic/epic17.svg" alt="">
    <p>Users can still choose what they want, but there is also circular navigation within the tests:</p>
    <img class="epic-full" src="img/epic/epic18.svg" alt="">
    <p>Should the user choose to follow the circular navigation, the finish button appears when all the tests are
      complete. Here, since the user wanted to test Microphone first and continue, the finish button appears at the
      Speaker test.</p>
    <img class="epic-full" src="img/epic/epic19.svg" alt="">
    <h5 id="design-header">Hi-Fi + Milestone Decisions</h5>
    <p>Our project team visualized milestone decisions best in hi-fi, so that was the stage in which we spent a good
      chunk of time! During this stage, we focused on mobile.</p>
    <img class="epic-full" src="img/epic/epic38.svg" alt="">
    <img class="epic-full" src="img/epic/epic20.svg" alt="">
    <img class="epic-full" src="img/epic/epic21.svg" alt="">
    <h5 id="design-header">Mid-summer Presentation</h5>
    <p>At this point was our Mid-summer Presentation, where we got some good feedback, as well as internally reflected
      as a project team on our progress and direction.</p>
    <img class="epic-full" src="img/epic/epic22.png" alt="">
    <p>Though we received praise for our compromise with Blended, we as a project team felt that our decisions had been
      too skewed by our feedback demographic’s higher technological skill, and wanted to revisit the scope of our target
      user.</p>
  </div>
  <img class="diamonds" src="img/epic/diamond4.png" alt="">
  <div class="define case-study">
    <h5 id="define-header">Customer Call</h5>
    <p>The customer that had sparked this project was available for a call, and our discussion with them helped narrow
      our focus.</p>
    <img class="epic-full" src="img/epic/epic24.svg" alt="">
    <h5 id="define-header">Persona</h5>
    <p>From there, we created a persona that would better set us up for our target user!</p>

  <div class="design case-study">
    <h5 id="design-header">Hi-Fi + Milestone Decisions</h5>
    <p>With this narrower scope, we were able to continue more confidently in our hi-fis.</p>
    <img class="epic-full" src="img/epic/epic27.svg" alt="">
    <img class="epic-full" src="img/epic/epic28.svg" alt="">
    <h5 id="design-header">Usability Testing</h5>
    <h4 id="design-bolder">Round 1</h4>
    <p>We were unsure about our choice to place troubleshooting at the end, and decided it might be best to inform our
      decision with some usability testing. We structured it as a <span id="blue">task-based</span> run-through of the
      test, as <span id="blue">our goal was to
        observe interactions in workflow</span>.</p>
    <img class="epic-full" src="img/epic/epic29.svg" alt="">
    <p>The consensus was clear: the anxiety of getting an error and having to wait to resolve it outweighs the anxiety
      from the error.</p>
    <img class="epic-full" src="img/epic/epic30.svg" alt="">
    <h4 id="design-bolder">Round 2</h4>
    <p>We ran another <span id="blue">task-based</span> run-through of the test to <span id="blue">validate our
        changes</span>, and were met with positive reactions!</p>
    <img class="epic-full" src="img/epic/epic31.svg" alt="">

    <p>All of this accumulated into our final presentation at Demo Days, where we got to showcase all of our hard work
      from the summer!</p>
