      <h1>Course Introduction + Prefaces</h1>
      <p>This project was the fourth and final undertaking of the course <b>DSGN 1: Design of Everyday Things</b>, taught by Professor Michael Meyers at the University of California, San Diego.
Centered around UCSD’s own Design Lab Director Don Norman’s <a target="_blank" href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262640374/the-design-of-everyday-things/">The Design of Everyday Things</a>, the course sought to challenge its students through
applying cognitive science principles to the design of both simple and complex technology. Students were introduced to foundational concepts
such as affordances, constraints, mappings, and conceptual models, and asked to apply their understanding of these concepts, along
with their observational and design skills, through a sequence of four group projects that reimagined everything from sparkwheel lighters to gear shifts to video chat interfaces.
      </p>
      <h2>Prompt</h2>
      <h5>“The final project should exploit the techniques covered in the first three projects*.
        The choice of topic is yours. In addition to observing, interviewing, and providing a
        data-driven design you will create a short video presenting your design.”
      </h5>
      <p>*Techniques covered in the mentioned first three projects included:
        “gain additional experience seeing as a designer by identifying problems with the design of
        a common everyday object, apply the ideas of conceptual models and gulfs of execution
        and evaluation in your analysis of the object, and start to develop experience with feeding
        the ideation process” (Projects <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dq1oe_SUes5VuQznlMnYbzSozVNBg5VqVPoj2zijV5s/edit?usp=sharing">1</a>
         and <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EP_iqBatE0tW7ObFYBePgts10LRH01Pszo436aAJT5A/edit?usp=sharing">2</a>), and designing for error by
        “reducing the opportunities to make errors”, “accepting that people will make errors and providing
        ways to mitigate their impact and recover from them” (<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1omg3it6Y9Tqp0vduFeoGwbR39gQgJINosXBI6-QXyEM/edit?usp=sharing">Project 3</a>).
      </p>
      <p>Essentially, we were tasked to make improvements to an existing digital or physical interface that we saw fit.<br>
      </p>
      <h2>Collaboration</h2>
      <p>I had a really great time working with Janzen Molina, Rajvir Logani, Shihan Gong, Sunay Bargotra, and Johnathan Tinajero
        on this project, and our original write-up submission can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cF1ULnYHJgvkF7I8z9CAepS1awFnxYDaHfZWUiF4yhU/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.
        Although I will be going into greater detail on my role and contributions within this project,
        this case study will draw upon group findings and could not have been possible without them!
      </p>

      <h1>Brainstorming</h1>
      <p>Our method of brainstorming involved making a collaborative mind map of our collective ideas,
        categorized as either digital or physical. Considering we had a little more time for this project in
        comparison to our past projects, we leaned towards our digital options as a change from our experience with
        physical redesigns (take a look at our previous physical redesigns <a href="play.html#dsgn1">here</a>!)

      <h2><br>Landing on a Design Issue and Preliminary User Research</h2>
      <p>We landed on two options that were both familiar to us as students and offered a narrow enough
        scope such that we could really hone in on individual features: <b>Zoom</b>, a widely used video
        communication platform, and the <b>Pronto App</b>, the mobile application for the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System.

          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>We took a closer look at aspects of Zoom and Pronto that we could focus on, and
        <b>ultimately decided on Zoom for its accessibility to all of us as student designers</b>
. While Pronto’s design raises really great design conversations on intermediates of physical and digital designs,
i.e. the interaction between the physical scanners on the bus and Pronto’s digital ticket interface design,
the time constraints of the project deadline weren’t feasible for a project done virtually by us.
Zoom’s accessibility to us is also an indicator of accessibility to the greater student and workforce population,
meaning our user research down the road spanned a greater audience.
      </p>
      <p>We initially conducted an interview that questioned all of the communication features within Zoom:
         video, microphone, chat, and reactions. However, we recognized that covering all of these features would
         likely be too overwhelming and lack proper detail and quality to each feature, so
       </p>
       <h5>we ultimately decided to <b>focus on the chat</b>, as our data had shown multiple concerns in that particular area. Mentioned problems included issues with
       </h5>
       <img src="img/zoom/cs-quotes.png" alt="" id="quotes">
       <h1>User Research</h1>
       <h2>Methodology</h2>
       <p>As mentioned, we had to conduct two stages of interviews, as our initial
         scope ended up being too broad. I’ll mainly be explaining the questions from
         Stage 2 because those were the finalized ones used for data collection on the chat,
         but Stage 1 Questions can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HpL9zAA591KVQvtOpyFdQ07ZHmkHTZGh7kwjZHUqezw/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. We included General Questions, Task-Based Questions,
         and Post-Task Questions. While the interviewee was on call, we asked them to show us their
         screen and actions using another device, and we recorded their answers on a Google Form, following a master-apprentice model.
       </p>
       <h2>Audience</h2>
       <p>Our interviewees were mostly students from UCSD, but also included siblings,
         parents, and friends that spanned different age ranges and occupations. We understood
         that our user research was influenced by its majority in participants under
         23 years old, and technological skill may vary across ages, but we still feel
         it is a relatively accurate representation of Zoom’s target audience of students,
         teachers, and workers, as its primary function is video telephony communication for school or work.

       <h1>Problems + Trends</h1>
       <h2>Hidden Affordances within Chat Navigation</h2>
       <p>The chat recipient navigation lacked clear signifiers.
       </p>
       <h5><b>⅓ of our participants</b> pointed out frustration over scrolling through the list of people to message, especially in larger meetings, </h5>
       <p>and one expressed the need for a search bar to mitigate this; however,
         we found that there is a search bar, but its faintness in color, absence of an icon
         signifier and placement as flush with the rest of the participant names can make it
         seem almost like a subtitle, and not a clickable function.
       </p>
       <img src="img/zoom/chatSearch.png" alt="" id="chatSearch">
       <h2>Culturally Inconsistent Signifiers</h2>
       <p>Zoom allows you to save a .txt file of all the recorded messages in the chat to your computer, but
         there is no singular icon that indicates that. It can be found in the ellipses, which is typically
         understood as an opportunity for “additional information,” but “Save chat” is the only available option.
          This complicates what could’ve been a one step process by a singular button, into a two step process that
          hides the available function, and ½ of our participants had to guess where the button to save the transcript was.
        </p>
        <img src="img/zoom/chat2.png" alt="" id="chat2">
        <p>Our participants also seemed to struggle with attaching files to the chat because that signifier is not generally used.</p>
        <img src="img/zoom/attachingFiles.png" alt="" id="attachingFiles">
        <h2>Transcript Ambiguity</h2>
        <p>Task #6 asked users to save a transcript of the Zoom chat on their computer and send
          the file back into the Zoom chat. Although all other tasks merited some 5s, not a single
          participant rated this task’s ease to be a 5. This is most likely because once the chat is
          saved, all the feedback a user receives is “Chat saved”. Although there is a Show in
          Finder button, it doesn’t lead to a known file, but rather a Zoom generated folder, and the
          button itself wouldn’t be accessible to users after a certain amount of time. Participants also
          tended to accidentally send recently opened files instead of the specific transcript, so
          the ambiguity of transcript storage is the main issue.
        </p>
        <div class="saveChat">
          <img src="img/zoom/saveChat1.png" alt="" class="saveChatImg">
          <img src="img/zoom/saveChat2.png" alt="" class="saveChatImg">
        </div>
        <h2>Switching Between Direct vs. Group Message</h2>
        <p>One of the most common errors brought up by participants was accidentally sending a message
          intended as a direct message to the chat with everyone, and vice versa of sending a chat intended
          for everyone to a direct message chat. A participant provided a prime example of the error,
          recalling that their “teacher once meant to send a student a direct message and the whole class
          found out [their] friend was failing” the class. These mistakes are likely occurring from the
          indistinguishability within the dropdown of who the recipient is. Although there are differences
          in signifiers such as “Everyone” being grey and with black text and direct message being blue with white
          text and “(Direct Message)” in red. Because errors are still being made in spite of these signifiers,
          we know users require a more drastic model to feel secure in their shift.
        </p>
        <img src="img/zoom/dm1.png" alt="" class="dm">
        <h2>Locating Messages in Direct vs. Group Message</h2>
        <p>Because direct messages, messages sent by everyone, and breakout room messages are all in the
          same chat stream, it’s not only difficult to keep track and switch between recipients, but to
          find particular past messages. Participants noted that it was difficult to manage direct messages
          that were integrated within the main chat with everyone because the direct message moves up
          with every message sent to the main chat.
        </p>
        <img src="img/zoom/dm2.png" alt="" class="dm">
        <h2>Breakout Room Confusion</h2>
        <p>The singular chat stream raises specific concerns with breakout room chats because participants
          noted that it was unclear whether messages sent to the breakout room would only be seen by others
          in the breakout room, or by everyone in the meeting. The reason for this confusion is likely because
          in the breakout room, message recipients will say “to everyone”, yet everyone means everyone
          in the breakout room, not in the meeting.
        </p>

        </div>
        <h2>Chat Window Positioning</h2>
        <p>Zoom has three different chat window positions, one that’s docked to the side,
          one that’s a separate window, and one in the corner of the Zoom; users can manually
          shift between the three, but the automatic setting seems to be arbitrary. Participants preferred
          to have their chat windows docked to the right side of the Zoom, specifically noting that it was
          culturally consistent with the structure of other common platforms such as Twitch. For the pop-up window,
          users seemed to like that it took up a small amount of space, but this did limit chat space, and the pop-up
          window itself would often cover the Zoom meeting.

        <h2>Prototype Justification</h2>
        <img src="img/zoom/prototype1.png" alt="" id="prototype1">
        <p>We made all of the buttons more defined in general, but our redesign mainly features</p>
        <h5><b>more defined chat vessels</b>,<br>with one for the main meeting,<br>
 additional breakout rooms that the user was added into,<br>as well as any user-created direct message chats or group chats.
        </h5>
        <p>To preview the chat, one simply hovers over that chat’s icon. <br><br>
          Additional changes were made to message typing as well, such as replacing
          the “Attach File” and “Download Transcript” buttons and also adding a formal “Send” button.
        </p>
        <h2>Chat Placement</h2>
        <p>To combat the disruption caused by the pop-up chat window, we decided that no
          matter if the user was maximized in full screen or in a normal window, <b>the chat
          would expand to the side by default</b>. However, users will also have the option to dock the chat off
          into a separate window if that’s their preference by hovering over the split between the meeting and the chat.
        </p>
        <h2>Messaging Interchangeability</h2>
        <p>The original chat had low discoverability in where to alternate between sending a message to “Everyone” versus
          sending a “Direct Message,” which led to description-similarity and mode-error slips and memory-lapse mistakes,
          as users a) couldn’t find where to send a direct message, b) forgot to change it back to “Everyone” after
          direct messaging, and c) had trouble discerning which messages were direct messages, as they often got
          lost in the chat stream. We determined that it was best to <b>break up the chat stream into individual chats instead of a
          single continuous one</b>. This could be considered a constraint, as the elimination of the option to send a direct
          message in the same place as the main chat prohibits the user from even mixing it up that way.<br><br>
          Although we considered separating sections into email-style inboxes, our interviewees did like the original chat’s
          simplicity, so we compromised by incorporating different chats, but the ability to preview the chat by
          hovering over the chat icons, inspired by Discord.
        </p>
        <h2>Searching for Participants</h2>
        <p>The original chat interface included a search function; however, it was unclear and blended into the usual
          “Send a chat to…” title. We clarified this to be <b>automatically searchable when starting a new chat</b>,
          so users know who they’re sending messages to.
        </p>
        <h2>Breakout Rooms</h2>
        <p>It was mentioned by an interviewee that in a Breakout Room, it was difficult to distinguish if the
          send “To: Everyone” was to everyone in the meeting or everyone in the breakout room, which indicated the
          lack of clarity in signifiers, as well as a preface to more mode-error slips as that function is used
          identically to control recipients in the main chat room as well. Because of this, we <b>generated a new chat
          for each breakout room</b>, allowing users to feel secure in who they’re sending the messages to from the large title of
          “Breakout Room _”, as well as allowing users to <b>revisit breakout room chats</b> to talk to their
          group members in the event of any miscommunication.
        </p>
        <h2>Unclear Functions</h2>
        <p>The three buttons for sending a message were a piece of paper, an emoji, and an ellipses
          who’s only drop down was to “Save Chat.” This wasn’t really clear to our users, particularly
          because of the lack of cultural constancy, so we <b>swapped the signifiers</b> out for a paperclip for
          “Attach File”, and a download for “Save Transcript”. The addition of the “Send” button came with a
          user whose enter key was malfunctioning, which the original chat interface lacked alternatives for.
        </p>
        <h2>Trade-offs</h2>
        <p>Many of the programs trade-off clear signifiers for more space. They prioritize the ability to
          have a lot on the screen by making the buttons smaller. However, this can lead to a bigger gap between
          the gulf of execution and gulf of evaluation. Having a lot of space for viewing meetings is beneficial;
          however, many of our participants have stated errors because of misclicks or due to the lack of clear
          feedback. For example, the Zoom direct message only states in small text “(Direct Message).” This leads
          users to double and triple check if they are messaging someone, fearful of making a slip. This led to our
          redesign to include bigger buttons and separate panels for different chats. This may have used more space;
          however, it allows users to see everything happening clearly. We implemented a minimize button for users
          who do not care about seeing the chat and instead wish to see the lecture in full screen.

        <h1>Iteration Overview</h1>
        <p>According to Don Norman, there are two phases of the <b>Double Diamond of Design</b>:
          finding the right problem (<b>discovering-divergent and defining-convergent</b>) and finding
          the right solution (<b>developing-divergent and delivering-convergent</b>). In order to do this, designers
          follow a cycle for human-centered design consisting of 1) <b>observation</b>, 2) <b>idea generation (ideation)</b>, 3) <b>prototyping</b>, and 4) <b>testing</b>.
        </p>
        <p>During the <b>divergent</b> stage of finding the problem, we discovered the issue through observation. We employed the master-apprentice model of interviewees
          demonstrating their use of Zoom communication features such as the microphone, video, chat, and reactions to see the applied ethnography of the natural occurrences
          they encounter. As opposed to marketing research that intends to conduct large-scale observation in pursuit of mass buying, our design research focused on the
          niche of population that used Zoom, which was a target audience of students ranging from elementary level to college level, as well as industry professionals who use
          Zoom for meetings.
        </p>
        <p>Our <b>convergent</b> stage of definition and ideation began by identifying our interview data from the first form, where we found some accidents regarding microphone
          and video inconsistency, an indifference for reactions, and the outline of some issues with chat, like the lack of discoverability of direct messaging. From there,
          we actually revisited the divergent stage and observed using a new form, this time highlighting chat features. Only then did we land on our final problem, which was
          chat confusion, and thus a consequent need for separation between messages.
        </p>
        <p>After that, we began a <b>divergent</b> stage of developing, and began prototyping. There were a few components that we were keeping in mind: a) clarifying recipients
          and chats to minimize errors and b) though the chat is pretty well-used, Zoom’s primary function is a video telephony communication method, meaning that we wanted to
          preserve written communication while saving space. We made some low-fidelity wireframes, which involved a lot of back and forth critique that
          helped us identify unseen problems. We played around with alternate designs centered around tabs and email-style inboxes, but
          ultimately integrated all of our critiques for an interchangeable yet compact chat into a final design of a Discord-style interchangeability system.

        <p>Since this was a class project with a limited project deadline, we didn’t have a great chance to complete the final <b>convergent</b>
          stage of delivering by testing, but we would hypothetically disseminate a working prototype to our initial interview group to identify any
          improvements or continued dissatisfactions.
