      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I’ve taken German since the 6th grade, and loved the language and the process of learning itself;
        part of this process was meeting people who found just as much joy and reward in the challenge,
        and the two programmers who reached out about this project were actually friends I’d studied German with!
      </p>
      <h2>Collaboration</h2>
      <p>I took the design initiative on this, but the people who conceptualized and made it actually come to
        life are Aaron Z. Zhu, Columbia ‘25 studying Computer Science and Linguistics, and Andrew S. Chen,
        Stanford ‘25 studying Mathematics and Computer Science after developing the Chen Method for language-learning!
        They were enthusiastic to get their hands dirty when learning the nuances of design, and definitely
        encourage you to take a look at their work.</p>
      <h1>Project Plan</h1>
      <p>(Software Requirements Specification given to me when onboarded)</p>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>People who want to learn new vocabulary or jot down words need an easy way to save and keep
        track of the notable words and phrases they come across. Unfortunately, the leading browsers
        and browsing tools do not offer users an efficient way to do this. Wordrive solves this problem
        by helping users save words quickly and with minimal interruption to their reading. The extension is
        intended to be open-source software.</p>
      <h2>Intended Audience</h2>
      <p>The intended audience is Google Chrome users, particularly those who read on their browser and are
        interested in boosting their retention of vocabulary or keeping track of new words they learn.</p>
      <h2>Functionality</h2>
      <p>Users should be able to:</p>
      <ul style="list-style-type: square">
        <li>highlight a word or phrase on a web page and save it</li>
        <li>review the list of words they have saved</li>
        <li>manually enter a word (not through highlighting)</li>
      </ul>
